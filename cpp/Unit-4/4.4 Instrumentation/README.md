# 4.4 Instrumentation

```
Sue has just finished her first draft of a function to solve a Sudoku puzzle. It seems fast, but she is unsure how
fast it really is. How do you measure performance on a machine that can do billions of instructions per second?
To get to the bottom of this, she introduces counters in key parts of her program to measure how many times
certain operations are performed.
```
## Objectives

By the end of this class, you will be able to:

## ÔÇ∑ Instrument a function to determine its performance characteristics.

## Prerequisites

Before reading this section, please make sure you are able to:

## ÔÇ∑ Search for a value in an array (Chapter 3. 1 ).

## ÔÇ∑ Look up a value in an array (Chapter 3. 1 ).

## ÔÇ∑ Declare an array to solve a problem (Chapter 3. 0 ).

## ÔÇ∑ Write a loop to traverse an array (Chapter 3. 0 ).

## ÔÇ∑ Predict the output of a code fragment containing an array (Chapter 3. 0 ).

## Overview

```
One of the most important characteristics of a sorting or search algorithm is how fast it accomplishes its task.
There are several ways we can measure speed: the number of steps it takes, the number of times an expensive
operation is performed, or the elapsed time.
To measure the number of steps the operation takes, we need to add a counter to the code. This counter will
increment with every step, resulting in one metric of the speed of the algorithm. We call the process of adding
```
## a counter ‚Äú instrumenting .‚Äù Instrumenting is the process of adding code to an existing function which does

not change the functionality of the task being measured. Instead, the instrumenting code measures how the
task was performed. For example, if consider the following code determining if two strings are equal:
/************************************************* * IS EQUAL
```
* Simple function to tell if two strings are equal*************************************************/ (^)
bool isEqual(const char *{ text1, const char * text2)
while (*text1 == *text2 && *text2){
text1++;text2++; (^)
}
(^) } return *text1 == *text2;


```
Procedural Programming in C++ | Unit 4 : Advanced Topics | 4.4 Instrumentation | Page 357
```
## Unit 4

This same code can be instrumented by adding a counter keeping track of the number of characters compared:
/************************************************* * IS EQUAL

* Same function as above except it will keep track * of how many characters are looked at to determine (^)
* if the two strings are equal* instrumented. This function is
(^) bool isEqual(const char **************************************************/ text1, const char * text2) (^)
{ int numCompares = 1; // keeps track of the number of compares
(^) while (*text1 == *text2 && *text2)
{ (^) text1++;
text2++;numCompares++; // with every compare (in the while loop), add one! (^)
}
cout << "It took " <<return *text1 == *text2; numCompares << " compares \n";
}
Write a program to manage your personal finances for a month. This program will ask you for your budget
income and expenditures, then for how much you actually made and spent. The program will then display a
report of whether you are on target to meet your financial goals
(^) **Sue‚Äôs Tips**
It is a good idea to put your instrumentation code in #ifdefs so you can easily remove it before
sending the code to the customer. The most convenient way to do that is with the following
construct:
##define Debug(x) xifdef DEBUG (^)
#else#define Debug(x) (^)
#endif
Observe how everything in the parentheses is included in the code if DEBUG is defined, while it is
removed when it is not. With this code, we would say something like:
Debug(numCompare++);
Again, if DEBUG were defined, the numCompare++; would appear in the code. If it were not defined,
then an empty semi-colon would appear instead.

## Example 4.4 ‚Äì Instrument the Bubble Sort^

## Demo

```
This example will demonstrate how to instrument a complex function: a sort algorithm. This algorithm
will order the items in an array according to a given criterion. In this case, the criterion is to reorder the
numbers in array to ascending order. The question is: how efficient is this algorithm?
```
(^)

## Solution

## Possibly the simplest algorithm to order a list of values is the Bubble Sort. This algorithm will first

```
find the largest item and put it at the end of the list. Then it will find the second largest and put it in
the second-to-last spot (iSpot) and so on.
We will instrument this function with the numCompare variable. Initially set to zero, we will increment
numCompare each time a pair of numbers (array[iCheck] > array[iCheck + 1])is compared. For
convenience, we will return this value to the caller.
/**************************************** * BUBBLE SORT *****************************
* * of times elements in the array were compared.Instrumented version of the Bubble Sort. We will return the number
```
(^) int************ bubbleSort(int array[], int numElements)******************************************************** */
{ // number of comparisons is initially zero
int numCompare = 0;
// did we switch two values on the last time through the outer loop?bool switched = true;
(^) // for each spot in the array, find the item that goes there with iCheck
for (int iSpot = numElements for (int iCheck = 0, switched = false; iCheck <= iSpot ‚Äì 1; iSpot >= 1 && switched; iSpot‚Äì 1; iCheck++)--) (^)
{ (^) numCompare++; // each time we are going to compare, add one
(^) if (array[iCheck] > array[iCheck + 1])
{ (^) int temp = array[iCheck]; // swap 2 items if out of order
array[iCheck] = array[iCheck + 1array[iCheck + 1] = temp; ];
(^) } switched = true; // a swap happened, do outer loop again
}
(^) } return numCompare;
It is important to note that instrumenting should not alter the functionality of the program. Removing
the instrumentation code should leave the algorithm unchanged.

## Example 4.4 ‚Äì Instrument Fibonacci^

## Demo

```
This example will demonstrate how to instrument two functions computing the Fibonacci sequence. It
will not only demonstrate how to add counters at performance-critical locations in the code, but will
demonstrate how to surround the instrumentation code with #ifdefs enabling the programmer to
conveniently remove the instrumentation code or quickly add it back.
```
(^)

## Problem

```
As you may recall, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as the following:
ùêπ(ùëõ)‚âî {
```
```
0 if ùëõ= 0
1 if ùëõ= 1
ùêπ(ùëõ‚àí 1 )+ùêπ(ùëõ‚àí 2 ) if ùëõ> 1
Write a program to compute the nth Fibonacci number.
How many Fibonacci numbers shall we identify? 10Array method: 55
Recursive method: 55
In debug mode (compiled with the ‚ÄìDDEBUG switch) , the program will display the cost:
How many Fibonacci numbers shall we identify? 10Number of iterations for the array method: 9
Number of iterations for the recursive method: 177
```
(^)

## Solution

```
In order to not influence the normal operation of the Fibonacci functions, the following code was added
to the top of the program:
#ifdef DEBUG int countIterations = 0; // all the code that will only execute if DEBUG is defined
```
#define increment() countIterations++#define reset() countIterations = 0 (^)
#define getIterations() countIterations
#else // !DEBUG#define increment() (^)
#define reset()#define getIterations() 0 (^)
#endif
Thus in ship mode (when DEBUG is not defined), the ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù increment(), reset(), and
getIterations() are defined as nothing. In debug mode, these manipulate the global variable
countIterations. Normally global variables are dangerous. However, since this variable is only visible
when DEBUG is defined, its damage potential is contained. The last thing to do is to carefully put reset()
before we start counting and getIterations() when we are done counting.
reset();int valueArray = computeFibonacciArray(num); (^)
int costArray = getIterations();
This, coupled with increment() when counting constitutes all the instrumentation code in the program.

## Assignment 4. 4^

```
Our assignment this week is to determine the relative speed of a linear search versus a binary search using
instrumentation. To do this, start with the code at:
/home/cs124/assignments/assign44.cpp
Here, you will need to modify the functions binary() and linear() to count the number of comparisons
that are performed to find the target number.
Next, you will need to modify computeAverageLinear() and computeAverageBinary() to determine the
number of compares on average it takes to find each element in the array.
Example
Consider the file numbers.txt that has the following values:
1 4 10 36 47 92 100 110 125 136 142 143 150 160 167
For the above example, the list is:
10 41 102 363 474 925 1006 1107 1258 1369 14210 14311 15012 16013 16714
When we run the program on the above list, the program will compute how long it takes to find an element
in the list using the linear search method and using the binary search method. If I call linear() (a function
performing a linear search from left to right) with the search parameter set to 4 , then I will find it with two
comparisons. This means linear(list, num, 4) == 2 because the function linear() will return the number
of comparisions, list contains the list of numbers, and num is the number of items in list. Thus
linear(list, num, 47) == 5. To find the average cost of the linear search, the equation will be:
(linear(list, num, 1) + linear(list, num, 4) + ... + linear(list, num, 167)) / num ==(1 + 2 + ... + 15) / 15 ==
120 / 15 =8.0 =
To compute the average cost of the binary search, the equation will be:
(binary(list, num, 1) + binary(list, num, 4) + ... + binary(list, num, 1 67)) / num == 3.3
The user input is underlined.
Enter Linear search: 8filename of list: .0 numbers.txt
Binary search: 3.3
