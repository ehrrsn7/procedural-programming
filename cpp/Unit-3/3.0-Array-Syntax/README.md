# 3. 0 Array Syntax

```
Sam is working on a function to compute a letter grade from a number grade. While this can be easily done
using IF/ELSE statements, he feels there must be an easier way. There is a pattern in the numbers which he
should be able to leverage to make for a more elegant and efficient solution. While mulling over this problem,
Sue introduces him to arrays...
```
## Objectives

By the end of this class, you will be able to:

## ÔÇ∑ Declare an array to solve a problem.

## ÔÇ∑ Write a loop to traverse an array.

## ÔÇ∑ Predict the output of a code fragment containing an array.

## ÔÇ∑ Pass an array to a function.

## Prerequisites

Before reading this section, please make sure you are able to:

## ÔÇ∑ Demonstrate the correct syntax for a WHILE, DO-WHILE, and FORop (Chapter 2.3).

## ÔÇ∑ Create a loop to solve a simple problem (Chapter 2.3).

## Overview

```
In the simplest form, an array is a ‚Äúbucket of variables.‚Äù Rather than having many variables to represent the
values in a collection, we can have a single variable representing the bucket. There are many instances when
working with buckets is more convenient than working with individual data items. One example is text:
```
```
char text[256];
```
```
In this example, the important unit is the collection of characters rather than any single character. It would
be extremely inconvenient to have to manage 256 individual variables to store the data of a single string.
There are three main components of the syntax of an array: the syntax for declaring an array, the syntax for
referencing an individual item in an array, and the syntax for passing an array as a parameter:
```
## Declaring an array Referencing an array Passing as a parameter

Syntax:

```
< Type > < variable >[ size ]
```
Example:

```
int grades[200];
```
A few details:

## ÔÇ∑ Any data-type can be used.

## ÔÇ∑ The size must be a natural

```
number {1, 2, etc.}, not a
variable.
```
Syntax:

```
< variable >[< index >]
```
Example:

```
cout << grades[i];
```
A few details:

## ÔÇ∑ The index starts with 0 and

```
must be within the valid
range.
```
Syntax:

```
(< Type > < variable >[])
```
Example:

```
void func(int grades[])
```
A few details:

## ÔÇ∑ You must specify the base-

type.

## ÔÇ∑ No size is passed in the

square brackets [].

**Declaring an Array**

A normal variable declaration asks the compiler to reserve the necessary amount of memory and allows the

user to reference the memory by the variable name. Arrays are slightly different. The amount of memory

reserved is computed by the size of each member in the list multiplied by the number of items in the list.

The first part is the base-type. This is the type of data common to all items in the list. In other words, we

can‚Äôt have an array where some items are integers and others are characters. We can use any data-type as the

base-type. This includes built-in data-types (int, float, bool, etc.) as well as custom data-types we will create

in future semesters.

The second part is the name. Since the array name refers to the collection of elements (as opposed to any

individual element), this name is commonly plural. Another common naming convention is to have the ‚Äúlist‚Äù

prefix (int listGrade[10];).

The final part is the size. It is important to note that the compiler needs to know the size of the array at

compilation time. In other words, we cannot make this a variable that the user provides the value for. It is

legal to have a literal (example: 10 ), a constant earlier defined (example: const int SIZE = 10;) or a #define

resolving to a constant or a literal (example: #define SIZE 10). One final note: once the size has been specified,

it cannot be changed. We will learn how to specify the size at run-time using a variable later in the semester

(Chapter 4.1)

(^) **Sam‚Äôs Corner**
While it is illegal to have a variable in the square brackets of an array declaration, our compiler
lets it slide. It is a very bad idea to rely on a given compiler‚Äôs non-adherence to the language standard:
it will make it difficult to port (or move) the code to another compiler.
That being said, the new C++ standard (called C++11) makes an allowance on this front. Please read
about generalized constant expressions: C++11 Generalized constant expressions.

**Initializing**
When declaring a simple variable, it is possible to initialize the variable at the same time:
{
int variable1; // declared but uninitialized
variable1 = 10; // now it is initialized
int variable2 = 10; // declared and initialized in one step
}
It is also possible to declare and initialize an array variable in one step:
{
char grades[4] =
{
'A', 'C', 'B', 'A'
};
}
Observe how the list of items to initialize are delimited with curly braces ({}). Since the Elements of Style
demands that each curly brace be on its own line, we align them with the base-type. Finally, the individual
items in the array are presented in a comma-separated list.
**Declaration In memory Description**
int array[ 6 ];
?^?^?^?^?^?^
Though six slots were set aside, they
remain uninitialized. All slots are filled
with unknown values.
int array[6] =
{
3, 6, 2, 9, 1, 8
};

##### 3 6 2 9 1 8

```
The initialized size is the same as
the declared size so every slot has
a known value.
int array[6] =
{
3, 6
};
```
##### 3 6 0 0 0 0

```
The first 2 slots are initialized,
the balance are filled with 0. This is a
partially filled array.
int array[] =
{
3, 6, 2, 9, 1, 8
};
```
##### 3 6 2 9 1 8

```
Declared to exactly the size necessary to
fit the list of numbers. The compiler will
count the number of slots
```
```
int array[6] = {};
0 0 0 0 0 0
```
```
This is the easiest way
to initialize an array with
zeros in all the slots
```

```

#### Unit 3

(^) **Sam‚Äôs Corner**
Arrays are stored in memory in the most efficient way imaginable: just a continuous block of
adjacent memory locations. The array variable itself refers to (or ‚Äúpoints to‚Äù) the first item in that block
of memory. Consider the following memory-dump of a simple declaration of an array of characters:
In this example, the memory starts at
location 0x0012FF58.
**Declaring an array of strings**
Since arrays of characters are called strings, how do we make arrays of strings? In essence, we will need an
array of arrays. We call these multi-dimensional arrays and they will be the topic of Chapter 4.0.
{
char listNames[10][256]; // ten strings
}
Observe the two sets of square brackets. The first set ([10]) refers to the number of strings in the array of
strings. The second set ([256]) refers to the size of each individual string in the list. As a result, we will have
ten strings, each 256 bytes in length. This means the total size of listNames is sizeof(char) * 10 * 256.
We can also initialize an array of strings at declaration time:
{
char listNames[][256] = // the number of strings is not necessary,
{ // the compiler can count
"Thomas",
"Edwin", // use either "quotes" or {'E', 'd', 'w', ... },
"Ricks"
};
}


```

**Referencing an Array**
In mathematics, we can define a sequence of numbers much like we define arrays of numbers in C++. We
refer to individual members of a sequence in mathematics with the subscript notation: ùëã 2 is the second

#### element of the sequence X. We use the square bracket notation in C++:

```
cout << list[3] << endl; // Access the fourth item in the list
```
```
One important difference between arrays and mathematical sequences is that the indexing of arrays starts at
zero. In other words, the first item is list[0] and the second is list[1]. The reason for this stems from how
arrays are declared. Recall that the array variable refers to (or points to) the first item in the list. The array
index is actually the offset from that first item. Thus, when one references list[ 2 ], one is actually saying
‚Äúmove 2 spots from the first item.‚Äù
```
**Loops**

```
Since indexing for arrays starts at zero, the valid indices for an array of 10 items is 0 ... 9. This brings us to
our standard FOR loop for arrays:
```
```
for (int i = 0; i < num; i++)
cout << list[i];
```
```
From this loop we notice several things. First, the array index variable is commonly the letter i or some
version of it (such as iList). This is one of the few times we can get away with a one letter variable name.
```
```
The second point is that we typically start the list at zero. If we start at one, we will skip the first item in the
list.
```
```
The Boolean expression is (i < num). Observe how we could also say (i <= num - 1 ). This, however, is
needlessly complex. We can read the Boolean expression as ‚Äúas long as the counter is less than the number of
items in the list.‚Äù
```
(^) **Sue‚Äôs Tips**
It is very bad to index off the end of an array. If, for example, we have an array of 10
numbers, what happens when we attempt to access the 20th item?
{
int list[10];
int i = 20;
list[i] = -1; // error! Off the end of the list
}
The compiler will not prevent such program logic mistakes; it is up to the programmer to
catch these errors. In the above example, we will assign the value - 1 to some random location
of memory. This will probably cause the program to malfunction in an unpredictable way.
The best way to prevent this class of problems is to use asserts to verify our referencing:
{
int list[10];
int i = 20;
assert(i >= 0 && i < 10); // much easier bug to fix
list[i] = -1;
}
Always use an assert to verify that the index is in the range of legal values!


```
Procedural Programming in C++ | Unit 3 : Pointers & Arrays | 3.0 Array Syntax | Page 219
```
#### Unit 3

**Referencing an array of strings**

Arrays of strings are also referenced with the square brackets. However, the programmer needs to specify

whether an individual character from a string is to be referenced, whether an entire string is to be referenced,

or whether we are working with the collection of strings. Consider the following example:

```
{
char listNames[][256] =
{
"Thomas",
"Edwin",
"Ricks"
};
```
```
cout << listNames[0][0] << endl; // the letter ‚ÄòT‚Äô
cout << listNames[0] << endl; // the string ‚ÄúThomas‚Äù
cout << listNames << endl; // ERROR: COUT can‚Äôt accept an array of
} // strings. Write a loop!
```

#### Example 3.0 ‚Äì Array Copy^

#### Demo

```
It is possible to copy the data from one integer variable into another with a simple assignment operator.
This is not true with an array. To perform this task, a loop is required. This example will demonstrate
how to copy an array of integers.
```
(^)

#### Problem

```
Write a program to prompt the user for a list of ten numbers. After the user has entered the values,
copy the values into another array and display the list.
```
(^)

#### Solution

It is not possible to perform the array copy with a simple assignment statement:

```
arrayDestination = arraySource; // this will not work
```
Instead, it is necessary to write a loop and copy the items one at a time.

```
{
const int SIZE = 10; // we can use SIZE to declare because it is a CONST
int listDestination[SIZE]; // copy data to here. It starts uninitialized
int listSource[SIZE] = // copy data from here
{
6, 8, 2, 6, 1, 7, 2, 9, 0
};
```
```
// a FOR loop is required to copy the data from one array to another.
for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
listDestination[i] = listSource[i];
}
```
(^)

#### Challenge

```
As a challenge, modify the program to copy an array of floating point numbers rather than an array of
integers. Make sure you format the output to one or two decimals of accuracy.
```
As an additional challenge, try to display the list backwards.

#### Unit 3

**Arrays as Parameters**

Passing arrays as parameters is quite different than passing other data types. The reason for this is a bit subtle.

When passing an integer, a copy of the value is sent to the callee. When passing an array, however, the data

itself does not move. Instead, only the address of the data is sent. This means, in effect, that passing arrays is

always pass-by-reference.

**Passing strings**

As mentioned previously, strings are just arrays. Thus, passing a string as a parameter is the same as passing

an array as a parameter. For any parameter-passing scenario, there are two parts: the callee (the function being

called) and the caller (the function initiating the function call).

The parameter declaration in the callee looks much like the declaration of an array. There is one exception

however: there is no number inside the square brackets. The reason for this may seem a bit counter-intuitive

at first: the callee does not know the size of the array. Consider the following example:

```
/********************************************
* DISPLAY NAME
* Display a user‚Äôs name on the screen
********************************************/
void displayName(char lastName[], bool isMale) // no number inside the brackets!
{
if (isMale)
cout << "Brother ";
else
cout << "Sister ";
cout << lastName; // treated like any other string
return;
}
```
In this example, the first parameter (lastName) is a string. For the rest of the function, we can treat lastName

like any local variable in the function.

Notice that we use the parameter mechanism to pass data back to the caller rather than using the return

mechanism. We do this because array parameters behave like pass-by-reference variables.

```
/******************************************
* GET NAME
* Prompt the user for this last name
******************************************/
void getName(char lastName[]) // Even though this is pass-by-reference
{ // there is no & in the parameter
cout << "What is your last name? ";
cin >> lastName;
return; // Do not use the return mechanism
} // for passing arrays
```
Observe how both the input parameter (demonstrated in the function displayName()) and the output

parameter (demonstrated in the function getName()) pass the same way.


```
Page 222 | 3.0 Array Syntax | Unit 3 : Pointers & Arrays | Procedural Programming in C++
```
#### Unit

(^3)
Calling a function accepting an array as a parameter is accomplished by passing the entire array name. Observe
how we do not use square brackets when passing the string.
/*********************************************
* MAIN
* Driver function for displayName and getName
*********************************************/
int main()
{
char name[256]; // this buffer is 256 characters
getName(name); // no []s used when passing arrays
displayName(name, true /*isMale*/); // again, no []s
displayName("Smith", false /*isMale*/); // we can also pass a string literal.
// this buffer is not 256 chars!
return 0;
}
The complete program for this example is available on 3 - 0 - passingString.cpp:
/home/cs124/examples/3- 0 - passingString.cpp
When calling a function with an array, do not use the square brackets ([]s). If you do, you will be sending
only one element of the array (a char in this case). Observe how we can pass either a string variable (name) or
a string literal ("Smith"). In the former case, the buffer is 256 characters. In the latter case, the buffer is much
smaller. Therefore, the caller specifies the buffer size, not the callee. This is why the callee omits a number
inside the square brackets ([]s) in the parameter declaration.
(^) **Sam‚Äôs Corner**
Recall that we should only be passing parameters by-reference when we want the callee to
change the value. This gets a bit confusing because passing arrays as parameters is much like pass-by-
reference. How can we avoid this unnecessarily tight coupling? The answer is to use the const modifier.
The const modifier allows the programmer to say ‚ÄúThis variable will never change.‚Äù When used in a
parameter, it is a guarantee that the function will not alter the data in the variable. It would therefore
be more correct to declare displayName() as follows:
void displayName(const char lastName[], bool isMale);
If the programmer made a mistake and actually tried to change the value in the function, the following
compiler error message would be displayed:
example.cpp: In function ‚Äúvoid displayName(const char*, bool)‚Äù:
example.cpp:15: error: assignment of read-only location ‚Äú* lastName‚Äù


```
Procedural Programming in C++ | Unit 3 : Pointers & Arrays | 3.0 Array Syntax | Page 223
```
#### Unit 3

**Passing arrays**

Passing arrays as parameters is much like passing strings with one major exception. While strings are

frequently (but not always!) 256 characters in length, the size of array buffers are difficult to predict. For this

reason, we almost always pass the size of an array along with the array itself:

```
/*****************************************
* FILL LIST
* Fill a list with the user input
****************************************/
void fillList(float listGPAs[], int numGPAs)
{
cout << "Please enter " << numGPAs << " GPAs\n";
for (int iGPAs = 0; iGPAs < numGPAs; iGPAs++)
{
cout << "\t#" << iGPAs + 1 << " : ";
cin >> listGPAs[iGPAs];
}
}
```
In this case, the function would not know the number of items in the list if the caller did not pass that value

as a parameter.

(^) **Sue‚Äôs Tips**
(^) There are commonly three variables in the typical array loop: the array to be looped through,
the number of items in the array, and the counter itself. Each of these is related yet each fulfill
a different role. It is a good idea to choose variable names to emphasize the differences and
similarities:

#### ÔÇ∑ listGPA: The ‚Äúlist‚Äù prefix indicates it is an array, the ‚ÄúGPA‚Äù suffix indicates it pertains

to GPAs.

#### ÔÇ∑ numGPA: The ‚Äúnum‚Äù prefix indicates it is the number of items, the ‚ÄúGPA‚Äù suffix again

indicates what list it pertains to.

#### ÔÇ∑ iGPA: The ‚Äúi‚Äù prefix indicates it is an incrementer (or iterator).

Using consistent and predictable names makes it easier to spot bugs.

Observe how the caller can then specify the size of the array and, by doing so, control the number of iterations

through the loop:

```
/******************************************
* MAIN
* Driver program for fillList
******************************************/
int main()
{
float listSmall[5];
float listBig[500];
```
```
fillList(listSmall, 5); // make sure the passed size equals the true size
fillList(listBig, 500); // this time, many more iterations will be performed
```
```
return 0;
}
```
A common mistake is to pass the wrong size of the list as a parameter. In the above example, it would be a

mistake to pass the number 10 for the size of listSmall because it is only 5 slots in size.

```
This example will demonstrate how to pass arrays of numbers as parameters. Included will be how to
pass an array as an input parameter (to be filled) and how to pass an array as an output parameter (to
be displayed).
```
(^)

#### Problem

Write a program to prompt the user for 4 prices in Euros, and display the dollar amount.

```
Please enter 4 prices in Euros
Price # 1: 1.
Price # 2: 3.
Price # 3:.
Price # 4: 104.
The prices in US dollars are:
$1.
$5.
$0.
$144.
```
(^)

#### Solution

```
The function to prompt the user for the prices is an output parameter. Notice how we do not use the
ambersand (&) when specifying an output parameter if the parameter is an array.
```
```
void getPrices(float prices[], int num)
{
cout << "Please enter " << num << " prices in Euros\n";
```
```
for (int i = 0; i < num; i++)
{
cout << "\tPrice # " << i + 1 << ": ";
cin >> prices[i];
}
}
```
```
When the parameter is input-only, it is a good idea to include the const modifier to the array parameter
declaration to indicate that the function will not modify any of the data.
```
```
void display(const float prices[], int num)
{
// configure the output for money
cout.setf(ios::fixed);
cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
cout.precision(2);
```
```
// display the prices
cout << "The prices in US dollars are:\n";
for (int i = 0; i < num; i++)
cout << "\t$" << prices[i] << endl;
}
```
(^)

#### Challenge

```
As a challenge, modify the display() function so both the Euro and the Dollar amounts are displayed.
This will require you to make a copy of the price array so both arrays can be passed to the display
function.
```

```
#### Unit 3

(^) **Sue‚Äôs Tips**
(^) Always pass the size of the array as a parameter. The least problematic way to do this is to let
the compiler compute the number of elements. Consider the following code:
float listSmall[5];
cout << sizeof(listSmall) << endl; // sizeof(float) * 5 == 20
cout << sizeof(listSmall[0]) << endl; // sizeof(float) == 4
cout << sizeof(listSmall) / sizeof(listSmall[0]) << endl;
// 20 / 4 == 5 NumElements!
Thus, it is very common to pass the size of a list using the following convention:
fillList(listSmall, sizeof(listSmall) / sizeof(listSmall[0]) );
This expression is worth memorizing.
**Passing an array of strings**
Passing arrays of strings is a bit more complex than passing single strings. While the reason for the differences
won‚Äôt become apparent until we learn about multi-dimensional arrays later in the semester (Chapter 4.0), the
syntax is as follows:
/*******************************************
* DISPLAY NAMES
* Display all the names in the passed list
******************************************/
void displayNames(char names[][256], int num) // second [] has the size in it
{
for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) // same as with other arrays
cout << names[i] << endl; // access each individual string
}
Observe that, like with simple strings, the first set of square brackets near the names variable is empty. The
second set, however, needs to include the size of each individual string. When we call this function, one does
not include the square brackets. This ensures the complete list of names is passed, not an individual name.
/******************************************
* MAIN
* Simple driver program for displayNames
******************************************/
int main()
{
char fullName[3][256] =
{
"Thomas",
"Edwin",
"Ricks"
};
displayNames(fullName, 3);
return 0;
}

#4: Nephi

```

#### Solution

```
The function to prompt the user for the strings. Observe how the double square-bracket notation is
used and the size of each buffer is in the brackets:
```
```
void getNames(char listNames[][256], int numNames)
{
cout << "Who are your top " << numNames << " scripture heroes?\n";
```
```
// standard FOR loop
for (int iNames = 0; iNames < numNames; iNames++)
{
cout << "\t#" << iNames + 1 << ": ";
cin >> listNames[iNames]; // one element of an array of strings
} // is simply a string!
}
```
```
To call the function, we specify that the entire list of names is to be used by passing the names variable
without square brackets.
```
```
int main()
{
// declare the array of strings
char names[5][256];
```
```
// prompt the user for the data
getNames(names, 5 /*numNames*/); // send the entire array of strings
```

// display the list of names
display(names, 5 /*numNames*/);
```
```
return 0;

**Passing Characters, Strings, and List of Strings**

Consider the following functions:

```
void displayListNames(const char names[][256], int num) // second [] has the size
{
for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) // same as with other arrays
cout << '\t' << names[i] << endl; // access each individual string
}
```
```
void displayName(const char name[]) // no NUM variable, no value in the[]s
{
cout << "One single name: " << name << endl;
}
```
```
void displayLetter(char letter)
{
cout << "One single letter: " << letter << endl;
}
```
Given a list of names (fullName), we can call each of the above functions:

```
{
char fullName[3][256] =
{
"Thomas",
"Edwin",
"Ricks"
};
```
```
displayListNames(fullName, 3); // display all the members of fullName
displayName(fullName[2]); // display just the 3rd string in the list
displayLetter(fullName[2][0]); // display first letter of 3rd name
}
```
Given a single string (word), we can call only displayName() and displayLetter():

```
{
char word[256] = "BYU-Idaho";
```
```
displayName(word); // pass a variable with the data ‚ÄúBYU-Idaho‚Äù
displayLetter(word[4]); // pass the letter ‚ÄòI‚Äô
```
```
displayName("Vikings"); // pass a string literal ‚ÄúVikings‚Äù
}
```
Finally, given a single letter (letter), we can call only displayLetter():

```
{
char letter = 'C';
```
```
displayLetter(letter); // pass the variable ‚ÄòC‚Äô
```
```
displayLetter('K'); // pass the literal ‚ÄòK‚Äô
}
```

#### Assignment 3. 0^

This program will consist of three parts: getGrades(), averageGrades(), and a driver program.

#### getGrades

```
Write a function to prompt the user for ten grades and return the result back to main(). Note that any
variables declared in getGrades() will be destroyed when the function returns. This means that main() will
need to declare the array and pass it as a parameter to getGrades().
```
#### averageGrades

```
Write another function to find the average of the grades and return the answer. Of course, the grades array
will need to be passed as a parameter. The return value should be the average.
```
#### Driver Program

Finally, create main() that does the following:

#### ÔÇ∑ Has the grades array as a local variable

#### ÔÇ∑ Calls getGrades()

#### ÔÇ∑ Calls averageGrades()

#### ÔÇ∑ Displays the result

Please note that for this assignment, integers should be used throughout.
