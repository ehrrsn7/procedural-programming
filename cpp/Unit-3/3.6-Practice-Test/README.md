## Unit 3

# Unit 3 Practice Test

## Practice 3.3^

```
We are all habitual writers; our word choice and the way we phrase things are highly individualistic. Write
a program to count the frequency of a given letter in a file.
```
## Example

```
Given a file that contains the sample solution for this problem, count the frequency of usage of a given
letter in the file.
```
User input is **underlined**.

```
What is the name of the file: /home/cs124/tests/practice33.cpp
What letter should we count: t
There are 125 t's in the file
```
Another execution on the same file:

```
What is the name of the file: /home/cs124/tests/practice33.cpp
What letter should we count: i
There are 66 i's in the file
```
## Assignment

Write the program to:

##  Prompt the user for the filename

##  Read the data from the file one letter at a time

##  Compare each letter against the target letter

##  Display the count of instances on the screen

##  Use proper modularization of course.

Please use the following test bed to validate your answers:

```
