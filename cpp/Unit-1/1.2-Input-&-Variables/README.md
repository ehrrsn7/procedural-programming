## Unit 1: Simple Programs

### 1.2 Input & Variables

Sue is excited because she just got a list of ancestor names from her grandmother. Finally, she can get some traction on her genealogy work! Unfortunately, the names are in the wrong order. Rather than being in the format of \[LastName, FirstName MiddleInitial], they are \[FirstName MiddleInitial LastName]. Instead of retyping the entire list, Sue writes a program to swap the names.

#### Objectives

By the end of this class, you will be able to:

- Choose the best data-type to represent your data.
- Declare a variable.
- Accept user input from the keyboard and store it in a variable.

#### Prerequisites

Before reading this section, please make sure you are able to:

- Type the code for a simple program (Chapter 0.2).
- Use the provided tools to complete a homework assignment (Chapter 1.0).
- Display text and numbers on the screen (Chapter 1.1).

#### Overview

Variables in computer languages are much like variables in mathematics:

Variables are a named location where we store data

There are two parts to this definition. The first part is the name. We always refer to variables by a name which the programmer identifies. It is always worthwhile to make the name as unambiguous as possible so it won't get confused with other variables or used later in the program. The second part is the data. A wide variety of data-types can be stored in a variable.
