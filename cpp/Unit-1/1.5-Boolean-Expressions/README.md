# 1.5 Boolean Expressions  

## Objectives  
By the end of this class, you will be able to:  
* Declare a Boolean variable.  
* Convert a logic problem into a Boolean expression.  
* Recite the order of operations.  

## Prerequisites  
Before reading this section, please make sure you are able to:  
* Represent simple equations in C++ (Chapter 1.3).  
* Choose the best data-type to represent your data (Chapter 1.2).  

## Overview  
Boolean algebra is a way to express logical statements mathematically. This is important because virtually all programs need to have decision-making logic. There are three parts to Boolean algebra:  
1. **Boolean variables** â€“ variables enabling the programmer to store the results of Boolean expressions.  
2. **Boolean operators** â€“ operations that can be performed on Boolean variables.  
3. **Comparison operators** â€“ allowing the programmer to convert a number to a Boolean value by comparing it to some value.  

### Common Boolean Operators  
| Math | English | C++ | Example |
|------|---------|-----|---------|
| ~ | Not | `!` | `!true` |
| âˆ§ | And | `&&` | `true && false` |
| âˆ¨ | Or | `||` | `true || false` |
| = | Equals | `==` | `x + 5 == 42 / 2` |
| â‰  | Not Equals | `!=` | `graduated != true` |
| < | Less than | `<` | `age < 16` |
| â‰¤ | Less than or equal to | `<=` | `timeNow <= timeLimit` |
| > | Greater than | `>` | `age > 65` |
| â‰¥ | Greater than or equal to | `>=` | `grade >= 90` |

## Boolean Operators: And, Or, and Not  

### AND (`&&`)  
The Boolean operator **AND** evaluates to `true` only if both the left-side and right-side are `true`. If either is `false`, the expression evaluates to `false`.  

Example:  
```cpp
bool answer = leftSide && rightSide;
```

**Truth Table for AND:**  

| Left-Side | Right-Side | Result |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| `true` | `true` | `true` |
| `true` | `false` | `false` |
| `false` | `true` | `false` |
| `false` | `false` | `false` |

### OR (`||`)  
The Boolean operator **OR** evaluates to `true` if either the left-side or the right-side is `true`.  

Example:  
```cpp
bool answer = leftSide || rightSide;
```

**Truth Table for OR:**  

| Left-Side | Right-Side | Result |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| `true` | `true` | `true` |
| `true` | `false` | `true` |
| `false` | `true` | `true` |
| `false` | `false` | `false` |

### NOT (`!`)  
The Boolean operator **NOT** is a unary operator that negates the Boolean value.  

Example:  
```cpp
bool wrong = !right;
```

**Truth Table for NOT:**  

| Right-Side | Result |
|------------|--------|
| `true` | `false` |
| `false` | `true` |

---

## Comparison Operators  

### Equivalence  
The first class of comparison operators consists of **equivalence** and **inequality**. These determine whether values are the same or not.  

Example:  
```cpp
int grade = 100;
bool isPerfectScore = (grade == 100);  // Evaluates to true only when grade is 100
```

It is also possible to check if two values are not the same:  
```cpp
int numStudents = 21;
bool isClassHeldToday = (numStudents != 0); // True if class is held
```

### Relative Operators  
The second class of comparison operators performs relative evaluations:  
* Greater than `>`  
* Less than `<`  
* Greater than or equal to `>=`  
* Less than or equal to `<=`  

Example:  
```cpp
int numBoys = 6;
int numGirls = 8;
bool isMoreGirls = (numGirls > numBoys); // True
```

Comparison operators also work with floating-point numbers and characters:  
```cpp
float grade = 82.5;
bool hasPassedCS124 = (grade >= 60.0); // Passed if grade is 60 or higher

char letterGrade = 'B';
bool goodGrade = ('C' >= letterGrade); // True since 'B' comes before 'C'
```

## Example 1.5 â€“ Decision Function  

This example demonstrates how to write a function to make a binary decision (choosing between two options).  

### Problem Statement  
Write a program to compute whether a user qualifies for the child tax credit. The rule states:  
* You qualify if your income is less than $110,000 per year.  
* Otherwise, you do not qualify.  

#### Sample Output  
```
What is your income: 115000.00
How many children? 2
Child Tax Credit: $ 0.00
```

### Solution  
The key part of this problem is the function deciding whether the user qualifies for the tax credit.  

```cpp
bool qualify(double income)
{
   return (income <= 110000.00);
}
```

Observe how the function name clearly indicates what `true` means. If `qualify()` returns `true`, then the user qualifies for the tax credit. Otherwise, they do not.  

### Challenge  
Modify the above example to reflect the law more accurately:  
* The full $1,000 per child is given if income is less than $110,000.  
* The credit phases out at 5Â¢ per $1 over $110,000.  
* Families making more than $130,000 receive no credit.

## Order of Operations in Boolean Expressions  

With multiple Boolean operators, the **order of operations** becomes complex. Here is the priority order:  

| Operator | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `()` | Parentheses (highest precedence) |
| `++ --` | Increment, Decrement |
| `!` | NOT |
| `* / %` | Multiply, Divide, Modulo |
| `+ -` | Addition, Subtraction |
| `> >= < <=` | Greater than, Less than, etc. |
| `== !=` | Equality |
| `&&` | AND |
| `||` | OR |
| `=` `+=` `*=` | Assignment (lowest precedence) |

## Assignment 1.5  

Write a function to determine if an individual is a **full tithe payer**.  

### Requirements  
* Function accepts **income** and **payment** as parameters.  
* Returns a **Boolean value** indicating whether the user is a full tithe payer.  

### Example Output  

#### **Example 1: Full Tithe Payer**  
```
Income: 100
Tithe: 91
You are a full tithe payer.
```

#### **Example 2: Not a Full Tithe Payer**  
```
Income: 532
Tithe: 40
Will a man rob God?  Yet ye have robbed me.
But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee?
In tithes and offerings. Malachi 3:8
```

Test your solution using:  
```
