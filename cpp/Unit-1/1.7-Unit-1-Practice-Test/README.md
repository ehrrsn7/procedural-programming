# Unit 1 Practice Test

## Practice 1 .2^

Write a program to prompt the user for his grade on a test, and inform him if he passed:

## Example

User input is **underlined**.

```
What was your grade on the last test? 92
You passed the test.
```
Another example

```
What was your grade on the last test? 59
You failed the test.
```
## Three Functions

```
Your program needs to have three functions: one to prompt the user for his grade, one to display the
"passed" message, and one to display the "failed" message.
```
## Assignment

Please copy into your home directory the course template from:

```
/home/cs124/tests/templateTest1.cpp
```
Use it to create the file for your test. Please:

##  Write the program.

##  Compile it.

##  Run it to make sure it gives you the output you expect.

##  Run the style checker and fix any style errors.

##  Run the test bed and make sure that the output is exactly as expected:

```
testBed cs124/practice12 practice12.cpp
```
A sample solution is on:

```
/home/cs124/tests/practice12.cpp
```
```

**Grading for Test1**

Sample grading criteria:

(^) Exceptional
100%
Good
90%
Acceptable
70%
Developing
50%
Missing
0%
Copy template
10%
Template is copied Need a hint Something other
than the standard
template is used
Compile
20%
No compile errors
or warnings
One warning One error Two errors Three or more
compile errors
Modularization
20%
Functions used
effectively in the
program
No bugs exist in
the declaration
or use of
functions
One bug exists
in the function
Two bugs All the code
exists in one
function
Conditional
10%
The conditional is
both elegant and
efficient
A conditional
exists that
determines if the
grade is sufficient
A bug exists in
the conditional
Elements of the
solution are
present
No attempt was
made at the
solution
I/O
20%
Zero test bed errors Looks the same
on screen, but
minor test bed
errors
One major test
bed error
One or more
tests pass test
bed
Program input
and output do
not resemble the
problem
Programming
Style
20%
Well commented,
meaningful variable
names, effective use
of blank lines
Zero style
checker errors
One or two
minor style
checker errors
Code is
readable, but
serious style
infractions
No evidence of
the principles of
"elements of
style" in the
program
