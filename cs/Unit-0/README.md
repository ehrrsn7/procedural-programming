# Course Overview

Procedural programming is the process of solving programming challenges by breaking large problems into smaller ones. These sub-problems are called procedures.

## Goals

The goal of this class is that each student will be able to solve problems in C# and have a solid foundation in software development methodology. By the end of the semester...

* You will be well prepared for advanced C# courses and other computing majors. This class is the foundation on which all Computer Science (CS), Electrical Engineering (EE), and Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECEN) courses are based.
* You will have confidence in your ability to solve problems with C#. This class will include many opportunities for hands-on programming. By the end of the semester, you will have written more than thirty programs.
* You will possess a tool-bag of different approaches to solve software problems. Not only will we learn the mechanics of the C# programming language, we will also learn how to solve programming problems using procedural tools.
* You will have a firm foundation in the basic constructs of procedural C#. All the components of procedural programming (except classes and objects) will be learned in this course. Object Oriented Programming, the second half of the C# language, is the topic of next semester.

These goals will be explored in the context of C# using the Linux operating system or your preferred development environment.

## Course Layout

The course will be broken into four sections:

1. **Simple Programs**. How to write your first program and begin thinking like a programmer. At the end of this section, you will be able to write a program with multiple methods, IF statements, and complex mathematical operations.
2. **Loops**. The goal of this section is to be able to solve problems using loops. Additionally we will learn several tools enabling us to solve hard programming problems and manage programs with large amounts of complexity.
3. **Arrays**. Next we will learn how to handle and manipulate large amounts of data in increasingly complex data structures. Specifically, we will learn about arrays and file I/O.
4. **Advanced Topics**. The final section of the course will involve learning about a collection of specialized topics (multi-dimensional arrays, dynamic memory allocation, and instrumentation to name a few) in the hopes they will help us understand the main topics of the semester better. In other words, the goal is not to learn these specialized topics so much as to make sure we have nailed the fundamentals.

### Needing Help

Occasionally, each of us reaches a roadblock or feels like help is needed. This textbook offers two ways to bail yourself out of trouble.

If you find you are not able to understand the problems we do in class, work through them at home before class. This will give you time for reflection and help ask better questions in class.

If you find the programming problems to be too hard, take the time to type out all the examples by hand. Once you finish them, work through the challenge associated with each example. There is something about typing code by hand that helps it seep into our brains. I hope this helps.

# Computers and Programs

Sam is talking with an old high school friend when he finds out he is majoring in Computer Science. “You know,” said his friend, “I have no idea how a computer works. Could you explain it to me?”  Sam is stumped for a minute by this. None of the most common analogies really fit. A computer is not really like a calculator or the human brain. Finally, after much thought, Sam begins: “Computer programs are like recipes and the computer itself is like the cook following the instructions...”

### Objectives

By the end of this class, you will be able to:
* Identify the major parts of a computer (CPU, main memory, etc.).
* Recite the major parts of a computer program (statements, headers, etc.).
* Type the code for a simple program.

## Overview of Computers and Programs

Consider a simple recipe for making cookies. The recipe consists of the ingredients (the materials used to make the cookies) as well as the instructions (such as “stir in the eggs”). If the recipe was precise enough then any two cooks would be able to produce an identical set of cookies from the provided ingredients. Most recipes, however, are ambiguous. This requires the cook to improvise or use his best judgment. This analogy holds well to the relationship between computers and programs with one exception: the computer is unable to improvise:

* **Cook**: The cook is the computer executing the instructions.
* **Recipe**: The recipe is the computer program to be executed.
* **Ingredients**: The ingredients are the input to the program.
* **Cookies**: The cookies correspond to the output of the program.
* **Chef**: The chef is the person who came up with the recipe. This is the role of the programmer.

Your job this semester is to derive the recipe (computer program) necessary to produce the desired cookies (output) from the provided ingredients (input).

## Computers

Computers today are all based on the basic model developed by Dr. John von Neumann. They consist of a CPU (the part that executes instructions), the Memory (the part where programs and data are stored), the bus (the wire connecting all components), and the peripherals (input and output devices).

## Programs

There are many computer languages, each enabling the programmer to write a computer program. In this class, we will be using the C# language developed by Microsoft in the early 2000s.  A  C# program consists of two parts: the using directives and the methods inside a class. The using directives describe what tools will be used in the program and the methods contain the recipes themselves. The methods consist of individual instructions called statements:

<table>
<thead>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="border: 2px solid #4f81bd; vertical-align: top">
<p>// 1</p>
<p>The `using` statement allows the program to include a library.</p>
<p>The `System` library allows you to read/write data to the screen.</p>
</td>
<td width="2px" style="padding: 0"></td>
<td style="border: 2px solid #4f81bd; vertical-align: top">
<p>// 2</p>
<p>Every C# program begins with a class definition.</p>
<p>This tells the program where to begin execution.</p>
</td>
<td width="2px" style="padding: 0"></td>
<td style="border: 2px solid #4f81bd; vertical-align: top">
<p>// 3</p>
<p>The `Main` method is the entry point for the program.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">using System;                              // 1
/***************************************** // 2
* This program will display “Hello World!”
* to the screen.
******************************************/
class HelloWorld {                         // 2
    static void Main(string[] args)        // 3
    {                                      // 4
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); // 5
    }                                      // 6
}
</code></pre>

<table>
<thead>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="border: 2px solid #4f81bd; vertical-align: top">
<p>// 4</p>
<p>Every block of related code is surrounded by curly braces.</p>
<p>All classes and methods encapsulate their code with curly braces.</p>
</td>
<td width="2px" style="padding: 0"></td>
<td style="border: 2px solid #4f81bd; vertical-align: top">
<p>// 5</p>
<p>This line actually does the work for this program.</p>
<p>We are displaying the text “Hello World!” to the output using `Console.WriteLine`.</p>
</td>
<td width="2px" style="padding: 0"></td>
<td style="border: 2px solid #4f81bd; vertical-align: top">
<p>// 6</p>
<p>The method ends here. In C#, the `Main` method does not require a return statement if its return type is `void`.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**USING SYSTEM**: This simple program has a using directive at the top. The `System` library contains many useful tools that we will be using in every program this semester, including the ability to display text on the screen. There are other libraries we will be introduced to through the course of the semester, including `System.IO`, `System.Math`, and more.

**CLASS**: All C# programs are organized into classes. The class name should match the filename. The `Main` method is the entry point for the program.

**CURLY BRACES**: All the instructions or statements in a C# program exist in methods. The `{}`s (called “curly braces”) denote where the method or class begins and ends.

**CONSOLE.WRITELINE**: The first instruction in the program indicates that the text “Hello World!” will be displayed on the screen. We will learn more about how to display text on the screen, as well as how to do more complex and powerful tasks later in the semester.

**COMMENTS**: C# supports both line (`//`) and block (`/* ... */`) comments, just like C++.

## Comments

Strictly speaking, the sole purpose of a recipe is to give the cook the necessary information to create a dish. However, sometimes other developers also need to be able to read and understand what the code is trying to do. In other words, it is often useful to answer “why” questions as well as “how” questions. We use comments to address “why” questions.

Comments are notes placed in a program that are not read by the compiler. They are meant to make the program more human-readable and easier to adjust. There are two commenting styles in C#: line and block comments.

### Line comments

Line comments indicate that all the text from the beginning of the line comment (two forward slashes `//`) to the end of the line is part of the comment:

<pre style="min-width: 650px"><code>{
    // line comments typically go inside methods just before a collection
    //     of related statements
    Console.WriteLine("Display text"); // You can also put a line comment on the end
                                       // of a line of code like this.
}
</code></pre>

Some general guidelines on comments:

* Comments should answer “Why” and “How” questions such as “Why is this variable set to zero?” or “How does this equation work?”
* Comments should not state the obvious.
* When there are multiple related statements in a method, set them apart with a blank line and a comment. This facilitates skimming the method to quickly gain a high-level understanding of the code.

### Block comments

Block comments start with `/*` and continue until a `*/` is reached. They can span multiple lines, but often do not. We typically use block comments at the beginning of the program:

<pre style="min-width: 650px"><code>/***********************************************************************
* Program:
*    Assignment 10, Hello World
*    Instructor, CS124
* Author:
*    Sam Student
* Summary:
*    This program is designed to be the first C# program you have ever
*    written. While not particularly complex, it is often the most difficult
*    to write because the tools are so unfamiliar.
************************************************************************/
</code></pre>

All programs created for this course need to start with this comment block. Observe how the comment blocks starts with the `/*` at the top and continues until the `*/` on the last line.

We also have a comment block at the beginning of every method. This comment block should state the name of the method and briefly describe what it is designed to do. If there is anything unusual or exceptional about the method, then it should be mentioned in the comment block. The following is an example of a method comment block:

<pre style="min-width: 500px"><code>/**********************************************************
* MAIN
* This program will display a simple message on the screen
**********************************************************/
</code></pre>
