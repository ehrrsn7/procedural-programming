Instructions
Please note:
 There is a single tab at the start of each line, but nowhere else.
 There are 13 ‘=’s in the first column, 10 in the second. There are 2 spaces between the columns.
 The spacing between the ‘$’ and the right edge of the money is 9.
 You will need to set the formatting of the prices with the precision() command.
 Please display the money as a number, rather than as text. This means two things. First, the
numbers should be outside the quotes (again, see the example above). Second, you will need to
use the setw() function to get the numbers to line up correctly.
 Please verify your solution against:
