## About JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It allows you to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript on the server side, enabling you to build scalable network applications. For our purposes, we are using this runtime to simplify our code development process.

For more information, visit the [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
