## Setting Up Your Environment

2. Install VS Code using a script that has been prepared for you:

```

## Exploring the Repository

5. Open the repository in VS Code:

VS Code has a built in markdown preview feature. Just click on the icon with the magnifying class and window panes.

Another useful tip is to set the preferences within vs code:

  "workbench.startupEditor": "readme"
}
```
